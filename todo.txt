- have a line be able to refer to another line in the same or another text, e.g. ref: Kaikai 260, and have the program edit the text files so that the references are all symmetric
- parse morphology
- predict parse based on wordform
- predict gloss based on morpheme
- for the predictions, have it present options to the user like FLEx does when you click on the dropdown arrows for word analysis or lex entry
- CLI commands for approving an analysis throughout a text or the whole corpus
- CLI commands for replacing a partial-word parse/gloss with a new one (e.g. change all -ko-mu 'fut-3sg' to -komu '3sg.fut')
- search/grep for things, highlight them in colors in the terminal output
- change word analysis globally or throughout text
- change which lines are being edited during parsing
- search lexicon
- add lexical items that aren't in any text
- change which heuristic is used for guessing word analysis: most recently seen in text, most commonly seen in text, most commonly seen overall
