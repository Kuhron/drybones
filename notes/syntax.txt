This is a description of syntax used within DryBones text files
(i.e., NOT within raw data txt that will later be converted to DryBones, which has its own format, documented in
- {Hurukui repo}/RawDataEntry/RawDataToDryBonesConversionNotes.txt
and
- {Hurukui repo}/RawDataEntry/ConvertRawDataToDryBones.py
).

- Lines mentioning the production and judgment of the "frame utterance" are ones in which multiple options
    were tried for part of the utterance, e.g. "P ima kepu {B^ wora / P* w[e']pakhai}".
    Here the frame utterance is the part outside the curly brackets. The production and acceptability of it
    may differ from that of the resulting utterance once a given option is plugged in.
    In DryBones text, the options are not shown, as they are split onto separate lines so that each line
    shows an utterance in the language. This makes it easier to computationally query things like how acceptable
    it is to place certain words/morphemes together, without having to parse the optionality section.
    The frame utterance is thus not explicitly shown, but it can be inferred by comparing the lines with each
    option. These lines' designations will be the same except for a final letter appended to the line number,
    e.g. 4.111.24a and 4.111.24b.
- Things within the baseline (and other parseable rows) that will be ignored in-line are surrounded by angle
    brackets (<>). Use this sparingly, such as for labeling two sentences within the line as being uttered
    by different speakers in an exchange (for showing call-and-response types of examples). For most other
    kinds of notes, use a "Note" row.
