Design principles

General CLI design guidelines:

DO:

- Base everything on the text files, rather than the text files only being printed out as a representation of some data structure stored elsewhere. Build objects and caches up based on what is in the text files, not the other way around.

- If there are problems in the text file, like lines within a set being inconsistent lengths (which will break alignment), warn the user in stderr and tell them they need to fix it, and how. If these problems are in lines that don't affect what you're trying to do right now, don't worry about it and go ahead with what you're trying to do. If they do, tell the user the problem and say you can't do this action until the problems are fixed.

- Keep ground-truth raw baselines (label: BaselineRaw) taken directly from original transcripts. Copy this to a new row (label: Baseline) where you will make your edits. This way you will always easily have a reference of what the transcribers (yourself included) originally heard.


DO NOT:

- Do not have morphemes/wordforms/etc. that are references like FLEx does. I want to be able to break those dependencies at any time by just going into the text files myself and changing something. DryBones should only infer that two things are the same after the fact, once it loads the corpus. Changing one instance of e.g. "-kha" 'irr.ss' should have no effect on the other instances unless we are doing a mass replace across a line, across a text, or across the whole corpus.

- Do not use text from FLEx exports as raw baselines, because FLEx adds spaces around punctuation marks and other changes. These are minor, but they are still deviations from the ground-truth raw baseline.

- Do not implement any features that are already easily available in text file manipulation tools, such as simple find-and-replace in sed. This would be reinventing the wheel. Rely on users' resourcefulness to use these tools as needed, and focus your DryBones development on features you want that are not already easily found elsewhere.


More tentative ideas:

- could try making REPLs using prompt-toolkit instead of, or in addition to, Click (since it appears Click may not be well suited for making REPLs)
- probably a better idea here is to mockup basic functionality in pure Python before getting invested in libraries any more than you already are; Click is great for the things you've used it for like creating/deleting a project, displaying usage/help/version, simple one-shot command things like that, but not good for interactive session stuff like how you want parsing to work; better to try to implement a really basic idea of what the parsing workflow will look like in pure Python so you can get the ideas down first and figure out the best library to streamline that (if any) later
